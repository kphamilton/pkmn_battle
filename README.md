This project was my initial Phonegap Application to learn how Phonegap works. It does the following:

- Loads in a config file of valid Pokemon and stats. 
- Loads in your team of Pokemon (including stats, attacks, etc).
- It then displays all valid Pokemon (your team plus the other valid Pokemon)
- When you click on a Pokemon in the list, it'll calculate (approximately) how much damage each attack of each Pokemon on your team will do the selected Pokemon.
- It also includes typical HP/Speed of defending Pokemon as well so you can see if you'll likely go first in the attack.
- The Pokemon on your team are ranked in order of who can do the most damage to the selected Pokemon.
- It also shows you the type advantages/disadvantages of your Pokemon versus the defending Pokemon.


The utility of this app is to aid me while battling friends in a Pokemon FireRed competition. I will use it as a reference of what I should be doing when the opponent sends out a Pokemon. the valid Pokemon being loaded are the ones we deemed legal for use in our competition. This is why there aren't the entirety of Pokemon in this app.

This application successfully compiles and runs on iPhone and Android (which was the purpose of the exercise).
